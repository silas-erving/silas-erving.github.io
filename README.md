<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hey! My name is Silas Erving — I’m a rising junior Software Engineering major at Morehouse College from Charlotte, North Carolina. As a Leo, I see the lion as my spirit animal: confident, curious, and always ready to lead. That mindset drives me in and outside of the classroom. At Morehouse, I’ve been committed to building a strong foundation in computer science, with a growing focus on High-Performance Computing (HPC) and science gateways. These interests sparked from a desire to not just learn theory, but to actively apply what I know through hands-on, real-world experiences.
I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of what I can do in tech. Whether it’s learning new programming languages, contributing to student leadership, or participating in summer institutes like SGX3, I’m always looking to grow. I bring a blend of technical skills — like C++, Python, and version control — with a collaborative spirit and a drive to make meaningful impact. Long term, I aspire to be part of teams that design scalable, innovative technology that improves access, connection, and quality of life — especially in underrepresented communities. I’m excited to take every opportunity that brings me closer to that goal.
